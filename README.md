Revolutionizing HealthCare – The impact of AI

ABSTRACT : 

Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. 
They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. 
By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care.

CA that can interpret human speech and respond via synthesized voices as well as manage tasks requested by the user are also known as voice assistants. 
Some of the most popular voice assistants include Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft’s Cortana.

We are going to develop a CA which is 24/7 available to the patients. 
The main motive is to provide the Primary Health Concerns of the people in order to avoid rushing to hospitals for small health care concerns.
